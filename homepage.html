<h2> Partnerships & Affiliations </h2>
<p> 
 In the current economic situation, it becomes mandatory for institutions 
 to increase their networking opportunities through affiliations and 
 partnerships. When partnerships are implemented correctly, the private 
 sector can increase efficiency and choice, and expand access to 
 education services, particularly for households that tend to be 
 poorly served by traditional delivery methods. 
</p>
